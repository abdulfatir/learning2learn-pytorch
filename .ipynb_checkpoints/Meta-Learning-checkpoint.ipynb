So here it is, the simplest version of the idea I could create, also no maths equations! I hope you find it illuminating.\n",

    "I think the reason for this, again as discussed in the paper, is that the magnitude of the values being fed into the LSTM can vary wildly and neural networks generally do not perform well when that happens. Here the gradients get so small that it isn’t able to compute sensible updates. The paper uses a solution to this for the bigger experiments; feed in the log gradient and the direction instead. See the paper for details.\n",
    "Hopefully, now that you understand how learn to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent you can see the limitations. It doesn’t seem very scalable. I think it is quite telling that the experiments in the paper are very small. It takes 4000 steps for even our toy problem to converge, we had to train a network completely just for one step of optimization for the meta-learner. We would have to optimize a large problem many more times and would take a very long time. Also unrolling the entire training loop in the graph is not feasible for larger problems, although in the paper they only unroll the BPTT to 20 steps. There is also evidence in the paper that the RNN optimizer can generalize from smaller problem to larger problems.\n",
